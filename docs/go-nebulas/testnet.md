# How to Join the Nebulas Testnet
## Introduction

We are glad to release the Nebulas Testnet. It simulates the Nebulas network and NVM, and allows developers to interact with Nebulas without paying the cost of gas.

### Build
The Nebulas Testnet's executable file and dependant libraries need to be built first. Several important modules are highlighted below:

* **NBRE:** The Nebulas Blockchain Runtime Environment is the platform for running Nebulas Protocol Representation, such as the DIP, the NR, etcetera. 
* **NEB:** The main process of the Nebulas Testnet. `NEB` and `NBRE` run in standalone processes, and communicate through IPC.

Details of building the modules can be found in [tutorials](http://wiki.nebulas.io/en/latest/go-nebulas/tutorials/01-installation.html#compile-nebulas).

### Configuration
The testnet configuration files are in the folder [`testnet/conf`](https://github.com/nebulasio/go-nebulas/tree/testnet/testnet/conf) under `testnet` branch, including:

#### genesis.conf
All configurable information about the genesis block is defined in genesis.conf, such as:

* **meta.chain\_id:** chain identity.
* **consensus.dpos.dynasty:** the initial dynasty of validators.
* **token\_distribution:** the initial allocation of tokens.

> _Attention_: DO NOT change the genesis.conf.

#### config.conf
All configurable information about the runtime is defined in config.conf.

Please check the [`template.conf`](https://github.com/nebulasio/nebdocs/blob/master/docs/resources/conf/template.conf) to find more details about the runtime configuration.

> _Tips_: the official seed node info is as below,

```javascript
seed:["/ip4/47.92.203.173/tcp/8680/ipfs/QmfSJ7JUnCEDP6LFyKkBUbpuDMETPbqMVZvPQy4keeyBDP","/ip4/47.89.180.5/tcp/8680/ipfs/QmTmnd5KXm4UFUquAJEGdrwj1cbJCHsTfPWAp5aKrKoRJK"]
```

#### API List
Test Endpoint:

| API | URL | Protocol |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| RESTful | [https://testnet.nebulas.io/](https://testnet.nebulas.io/) | HTTP |

* [GetNebState](https://github.com/nebulasio/wiki/blob/master/rpc.md#getnebstate): returns nebulas client info.
* [GetAccountState](https://github.com/nebulasio/wiki/blob/master/rpc.md#getaccountstate): returns the account balance and nonce.
* [LatestIrreversibleBlock](https://github.com/nebulasio/wiki/blob/master/rpc.md#latestirreversibleblock): returns the latest irreversible block.
* [Call](https://github.com/nebulasio/wiki/blob/master/rpc.md#call): execute smart contract locally. The tx won't be submitted on chain.
* [SendRawTransaction](https://github.com/nebulasio/wiki/blob/master/rpc.md#sendrawtransaction): submit signed transaction. The transaction must be signed before sending.
* [GetTransactionReceipt](https://github.com/nebulasio/wiki/blob/master/rpc.md#gettransactionreceipt): get transaction receipt info from the transaction hash.
