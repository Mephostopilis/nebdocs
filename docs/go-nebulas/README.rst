Downloads
---------

Bleeding edge code can be cloned from the branch of their git
repositories:

* `Mainnet <https://github.com/nebulasio/go-nebulas>`_
* `Explorer <https://github.com/nebulasio/explorer>`_
* `Web Wallet <https://github.com/nebulasio/web-wallet>`_

Mainnet
-------

`Nebulas mainnet <https://mainnet.nebulas.io>`_ Eeagle Nebulas launched on Mar 30, 2018. It's a basic public chain. There are two features:

* Supports javascript development
* Over 2000 TPS.

Nebulas NOVA launched in the end of 2018. There are three features:

- Nebulas Rank: measure the value of on-chain data

- Nebulas Blockchain Runtime Environment: instant upgrade the core protocols immediately

- Developer Incentive Protocol: provide native on-chain incentive for developers
