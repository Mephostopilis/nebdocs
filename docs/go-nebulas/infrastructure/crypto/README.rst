Crypto Design Doc
=================

Similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum, Nebulas also adopted an elliptic curve
algorithm as its basic encryption algorithm for Nebulas transactions.
Users' private keys will be encrypted with their passphrases and stored
in a keystore.


Hash
----

Supports generic hash functions, like sha256, sha3256 and ripemd160 etc.

Keystore
--------

The Nebulas Keystore is designed to manage user’s keys.

Key
~~~

The Key interface is designed to support various keys, including
symmetric keys and asymmetric keys.

Provider
~~~~~~~~

The Keystore provides different methods to save keys, such as 
`memory_provider` and `persistence_provider`. Before storage, 
the key has been encrypted in the keystore.

-  ``memory provider``: This type of provider keeps the keys in memory. After
   the key has been encrypted with the passphrase when user setkey or
   load, it is cached in memory provider.
-  ``persistence provider``: This type of provider serializes the
   encrypted key to the file. The file is compatible with Ethereum’s
   keystore file. Users can back up the address with its privatekey in
   it.

Signature
~~~~~~~~~

The Signature interface is used to provide applications with the 
functionality of a digital signature algorithm. A Signature object
can be used to generate and verify digital signatures.


There are two phases, in order to use a Signature object for signing data :

-  Initialization: with a private key, which initializes the signature
   for signing (see initSign() in the source code of go-nebulas).
-  Signing of all input bytes.

A Signature object can recover the public key with a signature and the
plain text that was signed (see function RecoverSignerFromSignature in
go-nebulas). So just comparing the from address and the address derived
from the public key can verify a transaction

   Similar to the `Android
   Keystore <https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html>`__,
   TPM, TEE and hardware low level security protection will be supported
   as a provider later.
