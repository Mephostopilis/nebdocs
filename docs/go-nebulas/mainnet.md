## Introduction

The Nebulas Mainnet 2.0 (Nebulas Nova) has been released. This tutorial will teach you how to join and work with the Nebulas Mainnet.

### Build

The Nebulas Mainnet's executable file and dependant libraries need to be built first. Several important modules are highlighted below:

* **NBRE:** The Nebulas Blockchain Runtime Environment is the platform for running Nebulas Protocol Representation, such as the DIP, the NR, etcetera. 
* **NEB:** The main process of the Nebulas Mainnet. `NEB` and `NBRE` run in standalone processes, and communicate through IPC.

Details of building the modules can be found in [tutorials](http://wiki.nebulas.io/en/latest/go-nebulas/tutorials/01-installation.html#compile-nebulas).


### Configuration

The Mainnet configuration files are in folder [`mainnet/conf`](https://github.com/nebulasio/go-nebulas/tree/master/mainnet/conf), including

### genesis.conf

All configurable information about genesis block is defined in genesis.conf, including

* **meta.chain\_id:** chain identity
* **consensus.dpos.dynasty:** the initial dynasty of validators
* **token\_distribution:** the initial allocation of tokens

> _Attention_: DO NOT change the genesis.conf.

### config.conf

All configurable information about runtime is defined in config.conf.

Please check the [`template.conf`](https://github.com/nebulasio/nebdocs/blob/master/docs/resources/conf/template.conf) to find more details about the runtime configuration.

> _Tips_: the official seed node info is as follows,

```javascript
seed:["/ip4/52.2.205.12/tcp/8680/ipfs/QmQK7W8wrByJ6So7rf84sZzKBxMYmc1i4a7JZsne93ysz5","/ip4/52.56.55.238/tcp/8680/ipfs/QmVy9AHxBpd1iTvECDR7fvdZnqXeDhnxkZJrKsyuHNYKAh","/ip4/13.251.33.39/tcp/8680/ipfs/QmVm5CECJdPAHmzJWN2X7tP335L5LguGb9QLQ78riA9gw3"]
```
