# Wiki Usage Guide

## How to edit a Wiki page
A full tutorial on how to edit Wiki pages can be found [here](https://medium.com/nebulasio/nebulas-wiki-user-guide-5418715c6988).

## Editing Software
For users who are familiar with git and would like to edit the Wiki locally, reST should be used to edit .rst files, and Pandoc Markdown for .md files.

Click [here](http://www.unexpected-vortices.com/doc-notes/markdown-and-rest-compared.html) to learn about the differences between Pandoc Markdown and reST. 

Below are some of the learning resources that can be used to further your knowledge of Markdown:

## The aftermath

When you edit pages on Github, you should always click on "Preview changes" to view the result of your labor. 

After your contribution has been merged, you can check the building process [here](https://readthedocs.org/projects/nebdocs/builds/).
