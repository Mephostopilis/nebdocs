## Editing Software
You should use reST to edit .rst files, and Pandoc Markdown for .md files.

Click [here](http://www.unexpected-vortices.com/doc-notes/markdown-and-rest-compared.html) to learn about the differences between Pandoc Markdown and reST. 

These are some learning resources:

- [How to use Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) by John Gruber
- [Markdown Guide](https://ia.net/writer/support/general/markdown-guide) by iA Writer

When you edit pages on Github, you should click on "Preview changes" to view the result of your labor. You can check the building process [here](https://readthedocs.org/projects/nebdocs/builds/).
