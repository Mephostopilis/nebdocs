# How to Contribute
> *Your contribution matters!*

> Nebulas aims for a continuously improving ecosystem, which means we need help from the community. We need your contributions! It is not limited exclusively to programming, but also bug reports and translations, spreading the tenets of Nebulas, answering questions, and so on.

Most of our projects and their corresponding bounties can be found [here](http://go.nebulas.io).

## 1. Code & Documentation
### 1.1. Mainnet Development
<!--Nebulas mainnet development is the most important and challenging portion of Nebulas technical development. -->
Besides programming, mainnet development is still ongoing and needs the help of the community to tackle challenging problems in the blockchain industry. For instance, we need to design manipulation-resistant mechanisms for blockchain, formally verify the new consensus algorithm, improve security of the Nebulas mainnet, apply new crypto algorithms to Nebulas, etcetera.

We are excited to devote ourselves to blockchain and to see how blockchain technology can improve people's lives. We want to share this exciting experience with the whole community. Thus, we call upon all developers!

### 1.2. Bug Reporting
We have always valued bug reporting!

If you find a bug, please report it to the Nebulas community. You will be rewarded for it. Check [the Nebulas Bounty Program here](http://wiki.nebulas.io/en/latest/bounty-program.html) for more details.

Bugs may be found on the Nebulas testnet, mainnet, nebPay, neb.js, web wallet, as well as other tools and documentation. We will follow the [OWASP Risk Assessment System](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology) to calculate the corresponding bounty/reward based on the risk degree of the bug. More TBA.

<!--Every time we launch a new function, we will first deploy it on our testnet. Currently, we have launched our first new function on the Nebulas testnet and everyone is welcome to try it, report any bugs discovered and receive the corresponding reward. The first of many new functions in public beta on the testnet is the inter-contract function.-->
If you have suggestions on how to fix bugs, or improve upon an affiliated project, please do not hesitate to let us know. You can also participate in the development and directly protect the onchain assets. Together, let’s make Nebulas even more safe, secure, and robust.
