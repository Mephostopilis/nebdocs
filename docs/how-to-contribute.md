### 2.1 Mainnet Development

Besides programming, mainnet development is still ongoing and needs the help of the community to tackle challenging problems in the blockchain industry. For instance, we need to design manipulation-resistant mechanisms for blockchain, formally verify the new consensus algorithm, improve security of the Nebulas mainnet, apply new crypto algorithms to Nebulas, etcetera.

We are excited to devote ourselves to blockchain and to see how blockchain technology can improve people's lives. We want to share this exciting experience with the whole community. Thus, we call upon all developers.

We are very glad that you are considering to help Nebulas Team or
go-nebulas project, including but not limited to source code, documents
or others. Read our [guideline](go-nebulas/develop/contribute.html) to learn more about development &

## 3. Documentation

### 3.1 Wiki & Translation

Translating is important to spread Nebulas to the whole world.


We welcome community members from around the world to participate in the translation of Nebulas documentation. You can translate everything from the [wiki](https://wiki.nebulas.io), including mainnet technical documents, the DApp FAQ, official documents such as the Nebulas academic papers, the Nebulas design principles introduction document, and more. Your contribution will significantly help numerous Nebulas developers and community members.
Please note that some documents will require an academic background in Math, Computer Science, Cryptography, and/or other specialties.

[wiki.nebulas.io](https://wiki.nebulas.io) ([Github](https://github.com/nebulasio/nebdocs)) is the platform to collect all these important documents both non-technical and technical.
