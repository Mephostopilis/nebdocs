Nebulas wiki
============

Welcome to the open-source Nebulas wiki!
----------------------------------------


Nebulas is a next-generation public blockchain, aiming for a continuously improving ecosystem. Based on its blockchain valuation mechanism, Nebulas proposes future-oriented incentive and consensus systems, and the ability to self-evolve without forking.

Nebulas community is open and everyone can be a contributor and build a decentralized world with us.

The Nebulas wiki is a collaboration tool for the community to publish various documents in a collaborative manner. Include `usage guides <wiki-usage-guide.html>`_, `development guides <dapp-development/README.html>`_, `learning resources <dapp-development/learning-resources.html>`_, and other useful documents.
