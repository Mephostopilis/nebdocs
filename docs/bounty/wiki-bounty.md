# Wiki

Previously users who created or modified content on the Nebulas Wiki were entitled to potentially win a bounty in the form of NAS. Nowadays, the process is quite different.

All projects are posted on the [Nebulas Project Page](go.nebulas.io) with their corresponding bounties, and users are expected to apply in order to claim a project or parts of it. This process also applies to the wiki. To qualify for the wiki bounty, go to the aforementioned project page and search for "wiki," or simply click [here](https://go.nebulas.io/search?q=wiki) to see all the available listings.
