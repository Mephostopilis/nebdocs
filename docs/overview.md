# Overview

Nebulas is a next-generation public blockchain, aiming for a continuously improving ecosystem. Based on its blockchain valuation mechanism, Nebulas proposes future-oriented incentive and consensus systems, and the ability to self-evolve without forking.

The Nebulas' community is open, and everyone can become a contributor and build a decentralized world with us.

The Nebulas wiki is a collaboration tool for the community to publish various documents in a collaborative manner. It includes [usage guides](wiki-usage-guide.html), [development guides](dapp-development/README.html), [learning resources](dapp-development/learning-resources.html), and other useful documents.
